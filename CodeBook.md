Codebook for assignment 1
===============================

## My notes: 
 * For this assignment I chose to use only the 3 combined text files in each of the folders ie y, x and subject. 
 * When the run_analysis.R script runs it starts of reading the features file to create a list of column names. It then incorporates the column names while reading in the data. 
 * The script starts of reading in the training data and tidying the data up including extracting only the mean and std columns. I used grep to extract only the columns with mean and std. When datasets where merged I used grep again to eliminate meanfreq from analysis.
